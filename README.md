MLOps Engineer passionate about bridging the gap between machine learning and operations. With a solid background as both a Machine Learning Engineer and a Cloud DevOps Engineer, I specialize in building automated, scalable, and reproducible ML systems.

My goal is to transform ML prototypes into production-grade solutions. I thrive on architecting CI/CD pipelines that ensure models are not just built, but are also reliably deployed, monitored, and retrained.

Core Competencies:
ü§ñ ML Lifecycle Automation: CI/CD for Machine Learning (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), Model Versioning, Experiment Tracking (MLflow).
‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Infrastructure: AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes (K8s).
üêç Programming & Data Science: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas.

I'm currently documenting my journey to master MLOps by building a portfolio of end-to-end case studies in public. Let's connect and talk about automating the future of AI!
